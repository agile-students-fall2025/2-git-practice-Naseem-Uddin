## What I found interesting

I was particularly struck by the scale of the partnership between OpenAI and Oracle — a **$300 billion deal** is enormous, and it signals how “industrial” AI has already become. What once may have seemed like research‐lab experiments is rapidly turning into massive infrastructure, operations, and commercial deployment.  

Another aspect I found interesting is how these types of partnerships raise questions around data ownership, resources, and ethical oversight. As big tech players consolidate control around both the tools (models) and platforms (cloud, infrastructure), the power dynamics will shift. Where it will go? Only those with power know.

I added this article because I’m interested in how AI is affecting not just software engineering, but also the infrastructure, business, and ethical layers around it.
